- get confusion matrix going (with arteries, with veins, with both)
- pickle your runs so you can play with output generation easier
- fix coloring & colorbar on graph
- try it with an eyeball
- figure out why smaller things are coloring over larger things (remove the smaller ones and see if larger are still there?)
- scale for each input better and try larger, more, less scales
- fix skeleton bullshit
- refactor pcsvn code to be more readable & pseudocodey
