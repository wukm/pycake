* make a skeltrace network coverage custom function that passes into confuion
     where the skeltrace is dilated a bit so you can see, also custom colors
* FIX THE FUCKING OUTPUT MESS so you can return gammas etc.
* fix the border issue 
* figure out if doing the extra dilation does anything (guess it doesn't)
* figure out what to do / if you want to show anything about the hessian
