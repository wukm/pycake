    this will take an RGB trace image (MxNx3) and return a 2D (MxN)
    "labeled" trace corresponding to the traced pixel length.
    there is no distinguishing between arteries and vessels

    it's preferrable to do this in real-time so only one tracefile
    needs to be stored (making the sample folder less cluttered)
    although obviously at the expense of storing a larger image
    which is only needed for visualization purposes.

    Input:
        T: a MxNx3 RGB (uint8) array, where the colorations are
        assumed as described in NOTES below.

    Output:
        widthtrace: a MxN array whose inputs describe the width of the
        vessel (in pixels), see NOTES.

    Notes:

        The correspondence is as follows:
        3 pixels: "#ff006f",  # magenta
        5 pixels: "#a80000",  # dark red
        7 pixels: "#a800ff",  # purple
        9 pixels: "#ff00ff",  # light pink
        11 pixels: "#008aff",  # blue
        13 pixels: "#8aff00",  # green
        15 pixels: "#ffc800",  # dark yellow
        17 pixels: "#ff8a00",  # orange
        19 pixels: "#ff0015"   # bright red

    According to the original tracing protocol, the traced vessels are
    binned into these 9 sizes. Vessels with a diameter smaller than 3px
    are not traced (unless they're binned into 3px).

    Note: this does *not* deal with collisions. If you pass anything
    with addition (blended colors) as the ctraces are, you will have
    trouble, as those will not be registered as any of the colors above
    and will thus be ignored. If you want to handle data from both
    arterial *and* venous layers, you should do so outside of this
    function.

    combine the widths from two RGB-traces A_trace and V_trace
    and return one width matrix according to `strategy`

    Parameters
    ----------
    A_trace: ndarray
        an MxNx3 matrix, where each pixel (along the
        last dimension) is an RGB triplet (i.e. each entry
        is an integer between [0,256). The colors each
        correspond to those in TRACE_COLORS, and (255,255,255)
        signifies "no vessel". This will normally correspond to
        the sample's arterial trace.
    V_trace: ndarray
        an MxNx3 matrix the same shape and other
        requirements as A_trace (see above). This will normally
        correspond to the sample's venous trace.
    strategy: keyword string
        when A_trace and V_trace coincide at some entry,
        this is the merging strategy. It should be a keyword
        of one of the following choices:

        "minimum": take the minimum width of the two traces
            (default). this is the sensible option if you
            are filtering out larger widths.
        "maximum": take the maximum width of the two traces
        "artery" or "A" or "top": take the width from A_trace
        "vein" or "V" or "bottom": take the width from V_trace

    Returns
    -------
        W : ndarray
        a width-matrix where each entry is a number 0 (no vessel), 3,5,7,...19

    Notes
    -----
    Since arteries grow over the veins on the PCSVN and are generally easier
    to extract, it might be preferable to indicate "arteries". In reality,
    each strategy is a compromise, and only by keeping track of both would
    you get the complete picture.

    No filtering out widths is done here.
