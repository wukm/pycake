A demo of fft-based gaussian blur vs. (standard) convolution-based gaussian blur on a test image.

average of 3 tests were done for each data point.

done on a 512x512 grayscale test image (camera guy).

for each implementation, vary size of sigma logarithmically (from 2^0 to 2^8).

This was produced by running the script hfft_demo.py
