these samples were generated in one loop (see alpha_sweep_demo.py , which is not a descriptive name). all alpha thresholds were generated by

scales = np.logscale(-2,4.5,num=20, base=2)
alphas = scales**(2/3) / scales[-1]

it seems it took about an hour and a half to run all 174 samples.

NOTES:

- there are a couple of samples for which no trace was generated. not sure
  why.

- after 30 or so takes, i'd apparently opened up the maximum number of
  plt.figure() instances, so i guess there was something i hadn't closed.
  wondering if that contributing to some error.

- obviously the alpha thresholds are not perfect, as some samples have very
  blotchy behavior at high scales.

TODO:

- get a MSE for the skeleton of generated trace and the skeleton of the
  "ground truth" trace

- categorically throw out some samples (high glare, bad collar, bad perfusion
  or whatever, etc.)

- better confusion colors

- generate a trace not with these colors but with the trace colors used in
  chang's paper / the original GIMP files
